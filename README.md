# Cisco Packet Tracer: ULSA - DMZ - Google Network Configuration  

This repository provides a detailed guide for building a network topology in *Cisco Packet Tracer, connecting three main segments: **ULSA, **DMZ, and **Google*.  

## Overview  

The topology is designed to ensure secure, efficient, and controlled communication through:  

- Network segmentation with *VLANs*  
- Dynamic routing using *EIGRP*  
- Traffic control with *ACLs* and a *firewall*  
- Automatic IP assignment via *DHCP*  
- Connectivity testing with *ICMP (ping)*  

## Network Components  

- *ULSA* and *Google*: configured with VLANs to enhance performance and security.  
- *DMZ: intermediate zone hosting services such as **FTP* and *DNS*.  
- *DHCP servers*: provide dynamic IP addressing for devices in each network.  
- *Firewall*: enforces access rules between segments (allowing HTTP, FTP, DNS, etc.).  

## Technologies Used  

- Cisco Packet Tracer  
- VLANs, EIGRP, ACLs, DHCP, Firewall, ICMP
